 Hello. This is my <b>first course</b> in computer programming. My background in computers includes basic usage of all types of applications for the Mac and PC. I currently work for my family's commercial fishing business. My hobbies change all the time. Right now, dog training and collecting records is consuming alot of my time. This is currently my last quarter before I attain my A/S degree. I am planning to study astronomy because it gets me excited.
